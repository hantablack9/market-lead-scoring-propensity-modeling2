# üß† Lead Scoring Using ML Algorithms ‚Äì Capstone Project

## üìå Problem Statement

In this capstone project, you are required to analyze a dataset and build a machine learning model that predicts the **propensity of a lead to purchase a course**. The objective is to help improve sales effectiveness by identifying high-conversion leads.

---

## üìÇ Dataset

**File:** `Purchase_Fraud_Data.csv`
Each row represents a lead with detailed attributes about their interaction, behavior, and metadata regarding the lead acquisition and sales journey.

## üìà Project Outline

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Descriptive Statistics**
  - Summarize numerical, categorical, and date columns.
  - Note key trends and anomalies.

- **Missing Value Treatment**
  - Identify nulls and treat using suitable techniques.

- **Univariate Analysis**
  - Numerical: Distribution plots, histograms
  - Categorical: Frequency bar plots

- **Multivariate Analysis**
  - Categorical vs Numerical: Bar plots, boxplots
  - Numerical vs Numerical: Scatter plots, heatmaps
  - Categorical vs Multiple Numericals: Group-wise distributions
  - Correlation matrix to evaluate multicollinearity

---

### 2. Feature Engineering

- Create meaningful new features from date/time columns.
- Transform skewed distributions.
- Encode categorical features appropriately.
- Engineer interaction terms or composite metrics where applicable.

---

### 3. Model Building

- Prepare dataset with cleaned and engineered features.
- Train baseline models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees).
- Evaluate using precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
- Tune hyperparameters for performance optimization.
- Optionally ensemble models for better generalization.

## üöÄ Objective

Deliver a well-performing, interpretable machine learning model that helps prioritize leads likely to convert, thereby improving sales efficiency.

<!-- 
## Getting started with your project

### 1. Create a New Repository

First, create a repository on GitHub with the same name as this project, and then run the following commands:

```bash
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "init commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:hantablack9/market-lead-scoring-propensity-modeling2.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment

Then, install the environment and the pre-commit hooks with

```bash
make install
```

This will also generate your `uv.lock` file

### 3. Run the pre-commit hooks

Initially, the CI/CD pipeline might be failing due to formatting issues. To resolve those run:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run -a
```

### 4. Commit the changes

Lastly, commit the changes made by the two steps above to your repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'Fix formatting issues'
git push origin main
```

You are now ready to start development on your project!
The CI/CD pipeline will be triggered when you open a pull request, merge to main, or when you create a new release.
